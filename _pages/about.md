# Custom PID Tuning Software

## Overview
Our Custom PID Tuning Software is designed to simplify the process of tuning Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. This software assists in recording values, generating models, evolving PID gains, implementing changes, testing outcomes, and fine-tuning the system for optimal performance.

## Features

### Record Values
Accurately record the values from your system to ensure that you have the precise data needed for tuning.

### Generate Model
Create a model based on the recorded values. This model serves as the foundation for calculating the PID gains.

### Calculate PID Gains
Using advanced algorithms, the software evolves the PID gains to achieve the desired system response.

### Implement
Easily implement the calculated PID gains into your system with minimal hassle.

### Test
Thoroughly test the new PID settings to ensure they meet performance expectations.

### Fine Tune
Make any necessary adjustments and fine-tune the PID settings for optimal performance.

We are committed to helping you achieve precision and control in your systems.
